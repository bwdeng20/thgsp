A **g**raph **s**ignal **p**rocessing toolbox built on [py**t**orc**h**](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch). The repository
now mainly consists of the following stuffs:

1. GFT-based filter(banks) processing multi-dimensional signals in a Multiple Input Multiple Output(MIMO) manner.
2. GraphQmf and GraphBiorth wavelet filter bank.
3. Many strategies to decompose an arbitrary graph into many(usually <10) bipartite graphs.
4. Many graph signal sampling(which differs slightly with
   [general graph sampling](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/littleballoffur>)) and reconstruction algorithms.

As this package is built on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)  and
[pytorch_sparse](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_sparse>), you can easily integrate functionalities from
**thgsp** into a PyTorch pipeline. Check the [document](https://bwdeng20.github.io/thgsp/)
for **installation** and introduction.

### GraphQMF four channel wavelet filter bank on Minnesota

The Minnesota traffic network is 3-colorable(exactly) or 4-colorable(roughly). Hence 4-channel GraphQmf filterbank is
constructed, requiring a ceil(log2(4))=2 level bipartite decomposition. The bipartite graphs are below.
